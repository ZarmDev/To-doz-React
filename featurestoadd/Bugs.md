Fix timer being able to hit multiple times

There are no limits to the input

Seems like the section CSS doesn't work and huge inputs make it very annoying to use

#addPane mimics height of the panes cuz of css

Cannot format text! And when pasting text, it can be in very unreadable colors/fonts

The left arrow to move around the toolbar buttons will move around itself
and be hard to click
