# To-doz-React
A to-do list site that ACTUALLY helps you get things done.
# Who is this for?
People who want to start a routine mostly, but you can also use it for projects.
If you have ever used duolingo, this site has a similar streak system.
# Contributing
You can contribute anytime!
**IF YOU ARE A COMPLETE BEGINNER**
**You can do: **

1.Download NPM

2.Get VSCODE (or a editor)

3.Open folder with this project (download)

4.Open up the terminal

5.Enter ``npm run start``

6.Now use it in your web browser

If you have no idea how to open react projects or NPM (I don't either), you can use github codespaces or you can just go to repl.it and make a new project from github (clone it)
