- Low power mode check if device is low power mode or add a setting

- Consider changing folder strucutre in components (really bad.)

- Add a go to bottom button on ALL pages (because say in the sections.js,
if you have like 20 sections you have to press add section and then go
all the way down)

- No pause indication in the focus session (especialyl in minimized window)

- Unfortunately, if someone manipulates the localstorage through cross-site scripting or can get it or something like that, then that
will let them make requests to their server or take the user's items
To prevent that, either use indexeddb or cookies

Steps:
- make sure to test it with data and configurations preloaded...
- Disable calendar feature in Dashboard.js for now
- Add error handling in the server
- Focus session not notifying on end - because of edge tab efficency or something
try to use web workers to fix that
- Test service workers to work offline
- Comment out password and remove user input
- Make it look nice in Data.js and add notes
