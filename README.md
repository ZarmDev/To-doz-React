# To-doz-React
**Temporary note: I'm trying to rewrite this project in Redux right now, with good React practices (previously hooks weren't being used and there was a lot of bad practice which could easily be sovled using Redux)**

It will probably take a while :(

**I also want to use a database feature where you can have a unique random generated username and a random generated password (to make sure any data breached isn't important)

or i'll just usegoogle auth like a normal person**

A to-do list site that helps you get things done.
# Who is this for?

If you have ever used duolingo, this site has a similar streak system.
