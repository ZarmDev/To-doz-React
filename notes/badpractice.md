- Uses localstorage
Cons: Data can be stolen by third-party-scripts (XSS?)
Pros: Persists (usually not deleted), Easy and already setup
- Doesn't use session cookies
Cons: maybe it's less secure than other sites I'm not sure

Accessibility:
- Very few accessibility features

Performance issues:
- using redux
