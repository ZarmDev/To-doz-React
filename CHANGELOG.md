- fixed song not playing when focus session minimized
- focus session now works when computer is asleep (AND TELLS YOU HOW MUCH TIME WENT BY!)
- focus session is more reliable
- focus session has a cool minimized window with a progress bar
(yes I "took inspiration" from microsoft clock)
- ❌HAVENT FINISHED CALENDAR FEATURE YET (in Dashboard.js)
why is it there? because I needed to commit everything before I worked
on a database feature 😈
- ❌11 vulnerabilities, will update packages in next update
- ❌Users who don't know how the minimized window works will wonder
why it's not working, but you have to set the time before pressing
the * button
- ❌Still many errors in the console
