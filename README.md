# To-doz-React
A to-do list site that:
- Contains self-hosted database integration
- Easily works on mobile
- Works offline and can be transferred to any computer
- Contains spotify features
- Has a focus session
- Takes a relatively small amount of storage
- Supports adding images, links, lists, etc

And is very performant! (I try to spend a lot of time optimizing the code)
# Who is this for?
People who want to start a routine mostly, but you can also use it for projects and saves.

Here is how I have been organizing it (I have been using it for 3 years of my
academic career)
