# To-doz-React
**Note: Although this project is made in React, in many components, it does NOT use
function components or React hooks (although in some places it's slowly being implemented).**
# What is this?
A to-do list I made originally to learn React, but now has a lot more features and even
helped me through my school years ðŸ’ª
# Who is this for?
People who want to start a routine mostly, but you can also use it for projects.
If you have ever used duolingo, this site has a similar streak system.
